## Privacy Policy {.unnumbered}

At RAISINS by Statoberry LLP, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information unless explicitly provided by the user for communication or support purposes.

-   We do not use third-party advertising tools.
-   We do not share your data with any third parties.
-   We collect only anonymized usage data (e.g., feature usage frequency) to improve platform performance and user experience.

Your use of RAISINS is secure, and we ensure that no unauthorized access occurs to any part of your interaction with the platform.

## Data Policy {.unnumbered}

RAISINS operates on a temporary, cloud-based computing environment.

-   **No uploaded data is stored permanently.**
-   Every analysis session is a virtual instance. Once the session ends (i.e., when the user closes the app or navigates away), all uploaded files, temporary outputs, and analysis results are **permanently deleted**.
-   No backup copies are created, and no user input is saved unless explicitly exported by the user.

This ensures that your data remains confidential and fully under your control. We do not retain any files, results, or metadata beyond the duration of your session.

> ðŸ’¡ **In short:** No uploaded data is stored anywhere. Once the user quits, everything in that session is lost forever.

## Refund Policy {.unnumbered}

-   For one-time purchases or subscriptions made in error, please contact us within 7 days of payment.

-   Refunds are not issued if a module was purchased in error; however, we will gladly switch access to the correct module upon request.

-   Refunds are only considered if the user was unable to access a module for more than one day (24 hrs) due to technical failure.  

-   Institutional and multi-user licenses are non-refundable once activated, except in cases of verified technical failure that prevents access.

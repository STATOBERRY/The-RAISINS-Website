## [RAISINS!]{style="background-color:#fff8dc; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:6px;"}

It all began with a simple idea: to make data analysis accessible, accurate, and stress-free for the agricultural research community. Back in 2020, we introduced **GRAPES** (General R-based Analysis Platform Empowered by Statistics) [www.kaugrapes.com](https://www.kaugrapes.com) a humble, R shiny -based tool designed for the students and researchers of Kerala Agricultural University. Little did we know then, it would grow into a trusted companion for more than 200,000 users worldwide and earn citations in over 150 indexed journals.

But growth brings new challenges. GRAPES, originally tailored for local use, struggled to keep pace with the scale and expectations of a global audience. We knew we needed to build something more robust, something that could not just meet, but anticipate the needs of modern agricultural research.

That dream took shape in 2024, when a spirited team of young statisticians came together to form [STATOBERRY LLP](https://www.statoberry.com/), under the mentorship of Dr. Pratheesh P. Gopinath, Head of the Department of Agricultural Statistics, College of Agriculture, Vellayani. From this dynamic collaboration emerged online web application for reseacrh data analysis in agriculture **RAISINS**-**R** and **AI** **S**olutions in **IN**ferential **S**tatistics. RAISINS can be accessed at [www.raisins.live](https://www.raisins.live/)

[RAISINS](https://www.raisins.live/) is not just another software. It is a complete ecosystem that brings together the power of R, Python, and AI in a seamless, point-and-click interface. Whether you're working on design of experiments, social science surveys, or advanced statistical genetics, RAISINS simplifies the process, automates best practices, and delivers publication-ready results without requiring you to write a single line of code.

## [Getting started]{style="background-color:#D2FFB0; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:6px;"} {#gettingStarted}

1.  **Go to** [https://www.raisins.live/](https://www.raisins.live/)

2.  **Click on Start** in the home page of RAISINS as shown in @fig-raisinsweb or simply scroll down

![RAISINS Home page](raisinsweb.webp){#fig-raisinsweb fig-align="center" width="100%"}

3.  You will be taken to the list of available modules in RAISINS under the [Data Analysis](https://www.raisins.live/#dataAnalysis) section, as shown in @fig-raisinsweb2. Click on any module to get started. Each module is self-contained and covers every aspect of its respective analysis from data input to interpretation. All RAISINS modules follow a consistent layout and workflow, making it easy for users to navigate and perform different analyses without having to learn each one separately.  

<details>  

<summary>What is a module?</summary>  

In **RAISINS**, each complete analytical tool or statistical application  such as *t-test*, *Regression Analysis*, or *CRD* is presented as a separate, self-contained application, which can be accessed indvidually. These individual applications are referred to as **modules**.  

</details>  


![Analysis modules are listed section-wise in RAISINS](rasinsweb2.webp){#fig-raisinsweb2 fig-align="center" width="100%"}

4.  **Clicking on any analysis module** will open up a window like that shown in @fig-modulewindow. Each module has three login options.  
  <span style="background-color:#a5cffa; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;"><strong>Preview Mode</strong></span>: Before subscribing to any module, you can explore RAISINS using the preview mode. Simply enter your email ID, and an OTP will be sent to your inbox. Use this OTP to log in and test any module with the built-in sample datasets. For your convenience, the OTP generated for your account remains valid until it refreshes at 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. (IST). This means you can revisit and explore multiple modules within that time window using the same OTP, without needing to generate a new one. Preview mode is an excellent feature for teaching, demonstrations, and learning how RAISINS works before making a subscription.  
    <span style="background-color:#76ad6d; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;"><strong>Get Started</strong></span>: This is the primary login option for users who have subscribed to any RAISINS module. Simply log in using your registered email ID and the password you created during registration. Once logged in, you can upload your own datasets, and begin your analysis seamlessly.  
     <span style="background-color:#b991c4; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;"><strong>Institutional Login</strong></span>: If you are subscribed to all RAISINS modules through the Unlimited Plan or have access via an institutional license, you can log in using this option. An OTP will be sent to your registered email ID, which you can use to log in. Like in preview mode  the OTP generated for your account remains valid until it refreshes at 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. (IST) and can be used to access all the modules included in your institutional plan.  
  
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="clock"}  
<span style="background-color:#d9d44c; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;">All OTPs generated in <strong>RAISINS</strong> are refreshed only at <strong>12 a.m.</strong> and <strong>12 p.m. (IST)</strong></span>
You don’t need to generate a new OTP each time — the same OTP can be used to access any module until the next refresh, for both Preview Mode and Institutional Login.
:::  

![RAISINS module window](modulewindow.webp){#fig-modulewindow fig-align="center" width="100%"}

5.  **If you are a beginner**, you might sometimes feel unsure about which analysis tool to choose or what tool is best for your data and research. That’s exactly where a statistician’s guidance becomes valuable and RAISINS offers you three simple ways to get it.  
    - **Ask our AI Statistician, RA-One (RAISINS Assistant One):** a free, intelligent assistant that helps you choose the right analysis and guides you through each step. See the instructions for accessing RA-One here 👉 @sec-RAone1
    - **Join our [Discussion Corner](https://www.raisins.live/discuss.html):** if you have a GitHub account, you can post your queries and interact with the RAISINS team and other users in an open, collaborative forum.  
    - **Email us directly at [support\@statoberry.com](mailto:support@statoberry.com):** our team will respond personally and help you with your analysis-related questions. In this option we will get back to you in a maximum of 3 working days.  
    
## [How each module works!]{style="background-color:#ccffee; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:6px;"} {#sec-appWork}  

The workflow of all modules or applications within RAISINS follows a uniform and intuitive pattern. This consistency is intentional as it ensures that users can move between different tools with ease and without confusion. The process is straightforward:

- Arrange your data file in the prescribed format (see @sec-prepfile).

- Click Browse and upload your dataset.

- Click `Run Analysis` and RAISINS will handle the rest!  

![RAISINS workflow](method.webp){#fig-modulewindow fig-align="center" width="100%"}

A sample module(application) window is shown in @fig-appwin1 and @fig-appwin2.  

### Four main tabs  

From @fig-appwin1, you can see how an application in **RAISINS** appears. Every application follows a similar structure with four main tabs, each serving a distinct purpose. The four tabs are:

<span style="background-color:#7b68ee; color:white; border-radius:50%; padding:4px 10px; font-weight:bold; box-shadow:1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">1</span> **Analysis:**  
This is the main workspace where the analysis is performed. You can upload your data file here, select the required variables or columns, and click **Run Analysis** to instantly view the results.  

<span style="background-color:#7b68ee; color:white; border-radius:50%; padding:4px 10px; font-weight:bold; box-shadow:1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">2</span> **Create Data:**  
This tab allows you to generate the required data format by providing the specified parameters. You can download the file in `.xlsx` or `.csv` format and use it for analysis. This feature is especially helpful if you’re unsure about the correct data structure.  

<span style="background-color:#7b68ee; color:white; border-radius:50%; padding:4px 10px; font-weight:bold; box-shadow:1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">3</span> **Datasets:**  
Each module includes built-in model datasets that you can use for testing. You can also download these datasets to understand how your own data should be arranged before uploading.  

<span style="background-color:#7b68ee; color:white; border-radius:50%; padding:4px 10px; font-weight:bold; box-shadow:1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">4</span> **User:**  
This tab provides details about your subscription and usage statistics. You can also view or download invoices related to your RAISINS access here.

![Inside a module in RAISINS](appwin1.webp){#fig-appwin1 fig-align="center" width="100%"}  

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"} 
All modules in **RAISINS** follow a similar workflow. Just upload your file in the prescribed format and click **Run Analysis**, as shown in @fig-appwin2.  
👉 You only need to be careful while arranging your data. You can refer to the model datasets in `Datasets` tab of each application or use the `Create Data` tab.  
See @sec-prepfile for key points to remember when preparing your file for upload.  
:::
 
   

![Click on Run Analysis after uploading the file](appwin2.webp){#fig-appwin2 fig-align="center" width="100%"}  

## [Preparing your file]{style="background-color:#ebd6ff; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:6px;"} {#sec-prepfile}  

In RAISINS you can upload file in xls, xlsx or csv format. But we recommend a csv format as it will be much lighter.  

### Preparing your data

You can create a file for upload in two simple ways:

1. **Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)**: create a **single sheet** with a clear header row and save as `.xlsx` or export to `.csv`.  
2. **Create data (recommended for beginners)**: inside each RAISINS module, open the **Create data** tab and enter the requested inputs in the sidebar.  
   *Example:* In the **CRD** module, provide the number of treatments, replications, and characters. RAISINS will generate a ready-to-fill `.csv` template that you can download, enter values, and upload for analysis.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="lightbulb"}
Detailed instructions on how to prepare data files are given inside each module and also in its corresponding tutorial. If you’re unsure about the required structure, download a **model dataset** from the **Datasets** tab in that module and mirror its layout.
:::

### Rules to follow

- Use a **single header row** with clean column names.  
- Data should begin in **cell A1**, with **no blank rows** above the header.  
- One **variable per column**, one **record per row**.  
- Save as **.csv** or **.xlsx** (both supported).

### Column naming: do’s and don’ts

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
  <thead>
    <tr style="background-color:#f8f9fa;">
      <th style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px; text-align:left;">✅ Do</th>
      <th style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px; text-align:left;">❌ Don’t</th>
      <th style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px; text-align:left;">💡 Why</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Use short, clear names: <code>yield</code>, <code>treatment</code>, <code>rep</code></td>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Long or vague names: <code>this_is_my_final_corrected_yield_value</code></td>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Short names read better in tables and plots</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Separate words with <code>_</code> or <code>.</code>: <code>plant_height</code></td>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Use spaces: <code>plant height</code></td>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Spaces can break code and labels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Use letters first: <code>r1_yield</code></td>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Start with a number: <code>1yield</code></td>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Column names shouldn’t start with digits</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Avoid symbols: <code>perc_mortality</code></td>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Use symbols: <code>percentage mortality (%)</code></td>
      <td style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:6px;">Symbols like <code>%</code>, <code>#</code> cause parsing issues</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

---

### A few column name examples to note

- `percentage mortality (%)` → `perc_mortality`  
- `Plant height (cm)` → `plant_height_cm`  
- `T1 Yield` → `t1_yield`

## [Preview login]{style="background-color:#cce6ff; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:6px;"} {#sec-plogin}   

This is an excellent feature we have introduced in RAISINS. It allows anyone to freely explore any module without registration, promoting open access and enabling global peer review, thereby enhancing transparency and credibility.  

When you click on a module,in the login window that opens up- simply select the `Preview Mode` button as shown in @fig-modulewindow. In @fig-preview, you can see how to access the preview mode using an OTP. As illustrated in @fig-pa, if you already generated an OTP in another module, note that it refreshes only at 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. each day. In such cases, you can use the button `I Already Have OTP` to proceed. Which will take you to the screen shown in @fig-pb, where you have to enter the OTP and get inside the app.

:::   

Once inside the app, you can explore all the available features, analyses, and plots using the inbuilt datasets. This allows you to fully experience how each module functions. However, please note that uploading your own dataset is not permitted in preview mode. A sample view of the preview mode interface is shown in @fig-pwinside.  

![Inside preview mode](entrypreview.webp){#fig-pwinside fig-align="center" width="100%"}  

## [Institutional login]{style="background-color:#fff3e6; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:6px;"} {#sec-Instlogin}  

This login feature is available to users who have subscribed to all RAISINS modules through the Individual Plan (unlimited plan), any customized plan, or whose institution is registered with us. You can access any module or only those modules included in your plan by clicking the `Institutional Login` button in the login window of the selected module, as shown in @fig-modulewindow.

An OTP will be sent to your registered email address for authentication. Similar to the preview mode, all OTPs are refreshed only at 12 a.m. and 12 p.m., allowing you to reuse the same OTP for logging into other modules within that time frame.

You can view the available subscription plans for RAISINS [here](https://www.raisins.live/plans.html)   

## [Module login]{style="background-color:#e6fbff; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:6px;"} {#sec-modlogin}  

RAISINS allows users to access each module independently through subscribing that particular module only. A feature designed with students in mind. If you have subscribed to a single module, you can start using it directly by clicking the `Get Started` button, as shown in @fig-modulewindow.


## [AI Assistant (RA-One)]{style="background-color:#fccfe1; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:6px;"} {#sec-RAone1}
